# First-MERN-Project 🚀

This project is created to get an idea about **POSTMAN-API** and the **MERN Stack**.

## Introduction 📝
This project demonstrates the use of the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) along with API testing using **POSTMAN**. The backend is designed to handle basic data submission to a MongoDB database via RESTful APIs.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database 🗃️
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js 🌐
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces ⚛️
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine 🖥️
- **POSTMAN**: API testing tool to interact with APIs 🧪


## Usage 💻
To test the API endpoints, you can use **POSTMAN** or any other API testing tool.

- **POSTMAN** allows you to send requests to the backend to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

Make sure to use **POSTMAN** to send requests to these endpoints and see how the data is handled in the backend.
